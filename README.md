# CPE-487-Final-Project
Piano Final Project (Lab 5 Siren Extension)  

Base Code of Lab 5 is provided here: https://github.com/byett/dsd/tree/CPE487-Fall2023/Nexys-A7/Lab-5  

Master file to access different components of the Nexys A7: https://github.com/byett/dsd/blob/CPE487-Fall2023/Nexys-A7/Nexys-A7-100T-Master.xdc  

Implementation of Lab 5 from the group are the files dac_if.vhd, siren.vhd, siren.xdc, tone.vhd, wail.vhd. These are the base for the project code as the Lab gave the siren sound on the waveform that can then be manipulated and implemented in a new way.  

Project code: (Make new page/section/tab for this by posting the files into the repo)
